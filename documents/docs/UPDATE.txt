Update instructions for running the Sphinx documentation tool for WHERE
=======================================================================

To update the documentation, it should be enough to run

    make html

This will run sphinx based on what is available in the source directory, and
output html-files to the build/html-directory. To see the documentation, either

+ open the file build/html/index.html in your browser, or

+ copy the build/html-directory to nnrite015:/home/geosat/doc-where/html and
  access the documentation at http://nnriap039/where/doc-where/

If new source files need to be included in the documentation, you should run
sphinx-apidoc from this folder as follows

    sphinx-apidoc -M -P -e -o source/ ../../where/

See sphinx-apidoc --help for an explanation of the flags. After doing an api-doc
update you should also run the following sed-magic:

    sed -i -e '1h;2,$H;$!d;g' -e 's/Submodules\n----------\n\n.. toctree::/Submodules\n----------\n\n.. toctree::\n   :maxdepth: 1/g' source/where.*rst

Unfortunately, there is no way to set maxdepth on Submodules using the
sphinx-apidoc program (and without it, we get a lot of noise from section
headers in the list of Submodules). This sed command takes care of that (we
specify Submodules very explicitly because Subpackages should not have a
maxdepth).
