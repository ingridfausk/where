# Introducing a New Software for Geodetic Analysis

## Abstract

At the Norwegian Mapping Authority, we are currently developing __Where__, a new
software for geodetic analysis. __Where__ is built on our experiences with the
Geosat software, and will be able to analyse and combine data from VLBI, SLR,
GNSS and DORIS. The software is mainly written in Python which has proved very
fruitful. The code is quick to write and the architecture is easily extendable
and maintainable. The Python community provides a rich eco-system of tools for
doing data-analysis, including effective data storage and powerful
visualization. Python interfaces well with other languages so that we can easily
reuse existing, well-tested code like the SOFA and IERS libraries.

This presentation will show some of the current capabilities of __Where__,
including benchmarks against other software packages. In addition we will report
on some simple investigations we have done using the software, and outline our
plans for further progress.
