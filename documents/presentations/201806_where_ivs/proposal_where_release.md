# Making Where available to the community

## Abstract

The Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket) is an associated analysis center
within the IVS, and we are currently preparing to contribute our VLBI analyses
to the IVS with our new __Where__-software. We also believe the software itself
can be useful for the community and will therefore make __Where__ availble under
an open source MIT-license.

This presentation will show how you can obtain your own copy of __Where__.
Furthermore, we will give a quick introduction to how the software works,
including many of the numerous options when setting up a VLBI analysis. We will
also explore how to look at and analyse the results with the companion
__There__-program.

__Where__ is built on open source software, primarily using the Python
language. While all models of the IERS 2010 conventions are implemented, it is
also easy to add alternative models or compare results from different models.

## Session -- S4 VLBI core products and their improvements

Conveners: John Gipson and Oleg Titov

The analysis of VLBI observations produces time series, long-term average
positions and rates, and values of physical parameters. We seek contributions in
topics such as the use of VLBI results in modeling geophysical fluids from the
atmosphere to the core, improvement of the precession-nutation model,
investigation of the Earth rotation variations at different time scales (from
minutes to decades), inner and outer core nutations, refinement of the
terrestrial and celestial reference frames, detection and interpretation of the
motions of specific sites and radio sources, atmospheric studies (both the
troposphere and the ionosphere), relativity tests, and other scientific uses of
geodetic and astrometric VLBI data and their impact on astrophysics and
cosmology. As 2018 will see the release of a new realization of the celestial
reference frame (ICRF3), we welcome presentations on individual solutions
provided by the IVS analysis centers to the ICRF3 effort as well as their
combinations. Other important topics are the comparison, validation, and
combination of VLBI with other space-geodetic techniques, and the integration of
the techniques within the framework of IAG’s Global Geodetic Observing System
(GGOS). Special attention is expected to be given to the assessment of the
actual accuracy and systematic errors of the VLBI-derived results, and, in
particular, to the errors caused by deficiencies of the models used in data
processing.
