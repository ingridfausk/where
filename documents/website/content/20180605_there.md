Summary: Use There to interactively explore the results of a Where analysis.


**There** is a companion tool to **Where**, and is installed as part of the
Where software package.

## What can There do?

_There_ is of course the answer to the question _Where?_ As such There - the
software program - is used to interactively explore the results of a Where
analysis.

The result of a Where analysis is a
[dataset]({filename}20180604_about.md#dataset) which contains timeseries of all
relevant variables in the analysis. A normal use of There is to plot timeseries
of residuals or estimation parameters, as is seen in the following screenshot:

However, There also has more advanced capabilities including:

+ Plotting related timeseries like for instance _x_, _y_ and _z_-site coordinates
  side-by-side or as a 3-dimensional plot

+ Comparing timeseries

+ Filtering timeseries to investigate given stations, radio sources and baselines

There also supports your analysis workflow, by letting you

+ Identify and add clock breaks to an analysis

+ Remove outliers

+ Update the configuration of an analysis

+ Rerun an analysis


## Running There

You can start the There program quite simply by issuing the command

    there --vlbi

on the command line. This will open the There program. Inside There you can then
explore all the analyses you have already done with Where.

> **Note:** On Windows the command to start There is `gd_there`. In all examples
> in this tutorial you should use `gd_there` instead of `there` if you are
> running on Windows.


### Opening a specific analysis

You can also choose to open There showing a specific analysis, by using a
command very similar to the one you used for running the analysis. For instance,
to open an analysis of the VLBI session for December 27 2016 you would do:


    there 2016 12 27 -v --session_code=R1772


### Timeseries

If you do not specify a specific analysis the default tab will show you the **timeseries** 
dataset. This dataset is intended to compare some parameters across different analyses.

Timeseries is a special dataset that is stored with the date 19700101. This
dataset contains many fields with one value for each processed session. For
instance by selecting *variance_factor* for the Y-axis this value can be showed
for all processed sessions. Clicking on a point in the plot will print some info
about the point in the command line window used to start There. This way
sessions with abnormal variance factors can be identified and investigated
further. By selecting the *Go go analysis* behaviour for *Double click*, and double clicking on a 
data point in the time series plot, There will switch to the **Analysis** tab and plot the dataset
the selected point was a part of.


### Rerunning single sessions

A single session may to some extent be manipulated through There. For instance
by selecting a station in the dropdown menu and then pressing *Ignore station*
the station will be added to the ignore_station field in the configuration
file. By pressing *Rerun* the session with be analyzed again and all data from
the station will be removed from the analysis.

Clock breaks may also be added by selecting the *Add clock break* behaviour for
*Double click*, selecting the station that has the clock break and then double
clicking on the plot where the clock break should be added. Adding clock breaks or removing observations
does not change the results. It only edits the configuration file. More complicated changes to the configuration
can be done by clicking the *Edit* button and writing directly in the configuration file. To apply the changes,
the analysis needs to be run again. This is done with the *Rerun* button.

### Customizing There

It is possible to customize much of the look and behavior of There. As with
Where, you do this through the configuration.

Any of the settings in `config/there.conf` can be overridden on the command line. For instance, to
change the colormap and the marker symbol used for scatter plots, you can do:

    there -v--colormap=rainbow --scatter:marker=+

There also uses
[configuration profiles]({filename}20180604_about.md#configuration-profile) to
simplify setting commonly used configuration settings. As with Where you can
explicitly specify one or more profiles to apply on the command line:

    there -v --profile=projector

The `projector` profile contains some settings that makes There better suited
for being displayed on the lower resolution that projectors normally deliver. In
addition, there might be profiles associated with pipelines (like VLBI) or
users. These are automatically applied.

To see all available configuration profiles, see the file
[`there.conf`](https://github.com/kartverket/where/blob/master/config/there.conf).

To make permanent changes to the default settings, it is recommended to create a new file
called `config/there_local.conf` and then add the changes to this file. Unlike `config/there.conf`, the 
local version will not be overwritten when a new version of Where is installed. Example `config/there_local.conf`:

	[general]
	colormap 	= rainbow
	
	[scatter]
	marker		= +
