The Norwegian Mapping Authority (NMA) is currently developing \textbf{Where}, a new software for geodetic analysis. The
software will be used to analyze VLBI sessions and contribute to the rapid and other operational products of the
International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS). All the components needed for a single session VLBI
analysis in \textbf{Where} are finished and the software is in its final testing phase. Together with the IVS
Combination Center the quality of the processed solutions are being evaluated and improved as problems are detected. The goal
is to have a fully working version of the VLBI part of the software before the end of 2018.
