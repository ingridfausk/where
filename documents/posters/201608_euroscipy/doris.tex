Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) is a
system consisting of a network of ground-based beacons emitting signals that are
picked up by satellites as they fly by. Satellite orbits and beacon positions
can be calculated based on the Doppler effect, the frequency shift of the beacon
signal caused by the satellite movement.
