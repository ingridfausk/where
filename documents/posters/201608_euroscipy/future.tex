At the moment the software has implemented all models needed for VLBI and SLR
analysis, as well as some of the GNSS models. We are currently working on the
estimation and postprocessing needed in order to get the final useful results
from the software.

The focus this fall will be on finishing the VLBI analysis and a simplified GNSS
analysis. This includes much testing including comparing our results to that of
other softwares. We will come back to the SLR and DORIS techniques later.
