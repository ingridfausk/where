Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) works by shooting at satellites with laser and
measuring the time it takes for the laser to be reflected off a satellite and
return to the laser station. These time measurements are used to calculate the
distance from the laser station station to the satellite. Doing this over time
gives very accurate satellite orbits.
