Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are networks of satellites used to accurately calculate positions on
Earth. Such systems include the American GPS, the Russian GLONASS and the European Galileo-system. They all work by
measuring the time a signal takes from the satellites to a receiver and calculating distances based on these.
