# Introducing a New Software for Geodetic Analysis

## Abstract

At the Norwegian Mapping Authority, we are currently developing __Where__, a new
software for geodetic analysis. __Where__ is built on our experiences with the
Geosat software, and will be able to analyse and combine data from VLBI, SLR,
GNSS and DORIS. The software is mainly written in Python which has proved very
fruitful. The code is quick to write and the architecture is easily extendable
and maintainable, while at the same time taking advantage of well-tested code
like the SOFA and IERS libraries.

This presentation will show some of the current capabilities of __Where__,
including benchmarks against other software packages, and outline our plans for
further progress. In addition we will report on some investigations we have done
experimenting with alternative weighting strategies for VLBI.
