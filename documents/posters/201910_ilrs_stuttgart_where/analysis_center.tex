The Norwegian Mapping Authority (NMA) is an associated analysis center within
the IVS and ILRS. Both the NMA and the Instituto Geogr\'{a}fico Nacional,
Spain, are in a test phase of deliveries of VLBI analysis results to the IVS
with the Where software. Some of our activities in VLBI is documented
in~\cite{kirkvik2017b} and~\cite{kirkvik2018}. 

Our goal is to be able to contribute to the ILRS after some improvements of the
software, and in the future recieve full status as operational analysis center
for both VLBI and SLR. 

Sharing and cooperating with other institutions is made possible by making
Where an open source project on GitHub.
