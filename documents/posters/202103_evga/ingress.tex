The road from the inauguration of the new geodetic observatory in Ny-\AA lesund in June 2018 to making the first successful
analysis of recorded data has been long and filled with problems. But the station NYALE13S is finally recording usable 
data. NYALE13S joined as tag-along for R1 sessions in July 2019 but the first fringe was not found until December 2019. 
And it was not until February 2020 multiple fringes were found and the data could be analysed. These first few sessions with
data from both the new station NYALE13S and the old station NYALES20 have been analyzed and results are compared to the 
preliminary results from the local tie measurements.
