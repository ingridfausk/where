# Where -- A New Software for Geodetic Analysis

## Abstract

The Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket) is an associated analysis center
within the IVS.  We are currently developing __Where__, a new software for
geodetic analysis. __Where__ is built on our experiences with the Geosat
software, and will be able to analyse and combine data from VLBI, SLR, GNSS and
DORIS. The software is mainly written in Python which has proved very
fruitful. The code is quick to write and the architecture is easily extendable
and maintainable, while at the same time taking advantage of well-tested code
like the SOFA and IERS libraries.

This presentation will show some of the current capabilities of __Where__,
including benchmarks against other software packages, and outline our plans for
further progress.

## Session

Session 3: Analysis

This session aims at contributions on the analysis of VLBI data, both for
geodesy and astrometry, and the derived results. Contributions concerning
e.g. earth rotation, the terrestrial reference frame, the celestial reference
frame, astrophysical and geophysical models, are encouraged.
