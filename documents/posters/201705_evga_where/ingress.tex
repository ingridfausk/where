At the Norwegian Mapping Authority, we are currently developing Where, a new
software for geodetic analysis. Where is built on our experiences with the
GEOSAT software, and will be able to analyse and combine data from VLBI, SLR,
GNSS and DORIS. The software is mainly written in Python which has proved very
fruitful. The code is quick to write and the architecture is easily extendable
and maintainable, while at the same time taking advantage of well-tested
libraries like the SOFA and IERS packages.

At the moment the VLBI analysis is close to ready. Comparison to other softwares
show that theoretical delay computations in Where are consistent with those. SLR
and GNSS analysis is well under way.
