GEOSAT is software for analyzing observations from geodetic
techniques, currently under development at the Norwegian Mapping
Authority.

An essential step in the production of the International Terrestrial
Reference Frame (ITRF) is to describe the weaknesses and strengths of
each contributing observation technique in terms of Helmert transformation parameters (Altamimi et al., 2011, ITRF2008, J. Geod. 85, 457). As a result, the ITRF
scale and geocenter will be dependent on choices based on how one
trusts the results derived from the involved data types (VLBI, SLR,
GNSS, DORIS).

Our aim is to use GEOSAT to develop a Terrestrial Reference Frame
(TRF) by taking more advantage of the full variance-covariance
information of estimated parameters to describe how the observation
techniques can complement each other. The resulting TRF will then, to
a greater extent, be defined by the observation noise of each
technique, and technique weaknesses and strengths will not be
restricted to Helmert type transformations.

With the use of a single software for the processing of all data types
it is ensured that the estimated parameter corrections are consistent.
