"""Framework for constructing a Dataset from observation files and apriori sources

Description:
------------

Each pipeline should be defined separate .py-file. The function inside the .py-file that
should be called need to be decorated with the :func:`~midgard.dev.plugins.register` decorator as follows::

    from midgard_dev import plugins

    @plugins.register
    def write_to_dataset(dset, rundate=None, **obsargs):
        ...

The decorated function will be called through the :func:`get`, with rundate and pipeline specificed as input
arguments. Additional parameters to the registered function should be passed as named keyword arguments.
