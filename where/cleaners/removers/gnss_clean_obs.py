    Keep only choosen GNSS observations and observation epochs, which at least 4 satellites. 

    NOTE: This only a workaround and works only if observations from one GNSS are used. If several GNSSs are used then
          it can happen that due to the fact that some observation type are only given for a certain GNSS, that all
          observations are deleted.
