"""Get gravity coefficients for a given gravity field

Description:

Reads data from gravity files. The gravity field to read is found in the configuration file. Files are assumed to be in
the ICGEM format [1] as available from the International Centre for Global Earth Models (ICGEM) website [2].

Usage of the gravity coefficients is described in the book 'Satellite Orbits' [3] as well as in section 6 of the IERS
Conventions [4]. The IERS Conventions 2010 recommend using the EGM2008 gravity field, which is described in further
detail at [5].
