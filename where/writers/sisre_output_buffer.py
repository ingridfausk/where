"""Write SISRE buffer file

Description:
------------
By determination of UERE based on Where SISRE results and Terrapos UEE results it is necessary to create a Where buffer
file. In the buffer file the path of the SISRE output file is written after successful processing of a day. The UERE
programs can access this file to check, if something can be processed.
